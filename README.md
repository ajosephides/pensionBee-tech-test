## Introduction
A solution to the PensionBee tech test. 

Original instructions can be found [here](insert link to readme).

## To run
* please clone repo
* run `npm install`
* navigate to `http://localhost:8888`

## Tests
* please run `npm test`

## Notes
* lots here was very new to me - went down some holes at points and have rushed some elements due to time constraints.
* **Improvements**
  * making it async when collecting and reading files. I tried to do this but struggled with a knowledge gap and so reverted to sync
  * I'm not convinced by my unit tests. I think these could be better and more thorough. I hit problems with understanding Jest mocking.
