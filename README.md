## Introduction
A solution to the PensionBee tech test. 

Original instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/ajosephides/pensionBee-tech-test/blob/master/README_original_instructions.md).

## To run
* please clone repo
* run `npm install`
* navigate to `http://localhost:8888`

## Tests
* please run `npm test`

## Improvements
* making it async when collecting and reading files. I tried to do this but struggled with a knowledge gap and so reverted to sync
* I'm not convinced by my unit tests. I think these could be better and more thorough. I hit problems with understanding Jest mocking.
